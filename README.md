Wireless Body Sensor Networks

This project is to design an end-to-end system of wireless Body Sensor Networks (BSN). The system consists of three main components: 
* The BSN with star topology with several wireless sensor (IEEE 802.15.4).
* The gateway device.
* The back-end server.

The system deploys a data analysis module in distributed manner which reduce the latency of the response.
